# Weekly Log
Please complete this log each week and submit by Friday at 5pm CST on gradescope.
The list items do not need to be overly, detailed but enough that I can understand where you are at and your progress.
You can add more items to the list than 2. If you find that an item is too broad/general, break it down into smaller tasks. 
Sometimes this is easier once you have spent time on the problem.

### Teams
If you are working with a partner please use initials for each item so I can understand how the team is breaking things down. Leaving the initials off indicates you worked together.

## Work Done
Rough estimate of hours worked: 15

This week I worked on (state if completed or work in progress WIP):
 - M-Way level 3 (completed)
 - M-pass level 3 (completed)

## Testing / Correctness / Evaluation
As you develop the components you should be active in evaluation of correctness and/or performance. Note high level tests or evaluations that you delivered this week. Also give any commands that you use to run these evaluations.
 - Test 1: unit tests for level 3 M-Way
 - Test 2: unit tests for level 3 M-Pass

## Blockers
This week I was blocked on or spent more time that I expected on (state if still blocked):

## Next week
Next week my plan is to tackle:
