# Weekly Log
Please complete this log each week and submit by Friday at 5pm CST on gradescope.
The list items do not need to be overly, detailed but enough that I can understand where you are at and your progress.
You can add more items to the list than 2. If you find that an item is too broad/general, break it down into smaller tasks. 
Sometimes this is easier once you have spent time on the problem.

## Work Done
Rough estimate of hours worked: 15

This week I worked on:
 - Milestone 1: level 1 sorting, level 2 sorting(complete)
 - Multi-threading (wip)

## Testing / Correctness / Evaluation
As you develop the components you should be active in evaluation of correctness and/or performance. Note high level tests or evaluations that you delivered this week. Also give any commands that you use to run these evaluations.
 - Test 1: unit tests for level 1 sort
 - Test 2: unit tests for sorted level 1 merge into level 2 runs
 - Test 3: unit tests for level 2 sort

## Blockers
This week I was blocked on or spent more time that I expected on (state if still blocked):

 - Sorting the runs take me more time than I thought, but it works now

## Next week
Next week my plan is to tackle:
 - M-Way level 3 sort-merge
